*"To be the frog, one must paint the frog"*

A crazy, meth-addict once shouted that at me just before lighting a vehicle on fire and throwing empty beer bottles my way at a semi large rave in the Southern California desert town known as [Slab City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_City,_California "Slab City Wiki"). That was a few years ago, but it really resonated with me. So much so, that I decided to paint a picture of the frog that man was shouting about....... with a fork!

**May the Fork be with you!!**
