June 23rd, 2020 marked the end of an era. Our cardboard cache was removed and presumably destroyed. A ridiculous act which was no doubt fueled by a political agenda and an enlarged pancreas. Our cardboard was the lifeblood of our warehouse, a monument of greatness. It was my last hope to keep Zeckos great again, and that has been lost.

Our cache had been building over the years, so much so, that we dedicated nearly an entire warehouse to keep it. Hell, our cardboard has been around longer than most of the people working out here. It sure meant more to me than any one of them.

### Memories

So many good memories of that beautiful pile of broken down boxes. I lost my virginity in that pile of cardboard! I remember like it was just a few days passed. So erotic, yet so painful…..paper cuts everywhere! I even have a few scars to prove it (pics in an upcoming post). I remember skipping the weekly warehouse meetings just hiding out in there, drinking a beer, having a toke. Mike Magee would come banging on the pile yelling for us to get out, but time was on our side, we sat quiet until he left and started the meeting without us. It was a sanctuary to crawl into and rest your weary eyes after an all night bender. The hours that I’ve been paid to snuggle up in that pile and burn some daylight are astronomical.

### Investment

The amount of time we had dedicated to our cardboard is incredible. The initial building of it. Moving it to a back corner. Moving it somewhere else. Moving it back to that same back corner. Then bringing it to its final resting place; getting its own warehouse which it deserved from the beginning.

We would build it as high as it could go, then it would fall over the following morning. We were determined, though, and would carefully stack it just a few inches higher each topple. After countless months of this back and forth, we needed to employ another method. This new method most closely resembled the Native American adobe buildings technique. Using whatever was around, we would form a plaster material to fill the gaps and give great strength to our pile. Pieces of trash, styro-foam chunks, invoices, to-do lists, Kit-Kat wrappers, chewed gum, and saliva are just a few of the items which were used. It was it’s own little ecosystem with molds and spiders that were found nowhere else in the warehouse.

### Healing

Now that there is a hole the size of a 14x10x10, in Zeckos, we begin the healing process. We are now pursuing a room filled with bags of styro-foam. Our old jewelry room is being stuffed with this crap faster than Danny can chug down a Chek-Cola. I have no idea what we will ever use this for. You sure can’t make sweet love in a pile of styro-foam! Believe me, I’ve tried. You think your bed is squeaky?

### Final Thoughts

While we soar like the Hindenburg, riding the coat tails of Trump checks sent to all taxpaying Americans, I can’t help but think that the destruction of our cardboard is the spark that ignites disaster. There is no doubt that this marks the downfall of Zeckos.

What will we pack with when management forgets to order packing paper? Where will we hide out during those pesky meetings? Now where do I spit my gum? Those are just a few of the questions that remain to be answered after the demise of our glorious Cardboard Cache. You will be missed!
