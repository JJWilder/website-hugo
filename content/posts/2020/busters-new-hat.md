Happy Holidays you cute little pig!!
<!--more-->
Buster and I were taking a sunrise stroll on the white sandy beaches of Hunting Island State Park in South Carolina. It was a beautiful morning! The ocean was calm and small waves were crashing on the beach as the tide began to move in. The sun rising higher and higher in the sky, warming our bodies from the chilly wind. We paused for a moment to soak in some rays when all of a sudden Buster jumps off my right shoulder and takes off!

I know what you're thinking; what was that adorable little pig doing on your right shoulder?  
Well, Buster will only sit on my right shoulder.  I've tried putting him on my left, and he just hops on over to the right. He says my right shoulder is just a little higher, and he gets a better view. He is correct, after examining myself in the mirror, my right shoulder is higher than my left. Now I've tried putting him on my head, but he says I play with my hat, scarf or hair too much for him to get comfortable. Can't say I blame him.

Buster went racing off down towards the ocean and started rooting around the sand as pigs do. He was so deep in that sand I could barely see his curly little tail sticking up. After a few moments he jumped up out of the hole he dug with a shell on his head. Grinning from ear to ear he asked, "Can I keep it, JJ?"  
"Of course you can!" I proclaimed.

Buster had found his holiday hat!!

The real gifts are not bought and sold. They surround us everyday, it's knowing where to look, rather, how to look. Dig deep enough, as hard as it sometimes is, and everything becomes a gift. May you find your gift this season.

Happy Holidays!!
