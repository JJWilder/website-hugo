The equinox has passed, cooler weather is moving in and the summer job is over!!<!--more-->
What a great summer it was!  What a hot summer is was!
Put in six months of work at Zeckos starting in March.  So much new but so much the same.  Always fun working there, and quite busy when I first began (those stimulus checks).

Have done a good amount of biking this summer.  Put some street tires on my old mountain bike which made the handling so much better on the asphalt.  That has been a great upgrade.
It's been my main transportation for most of the year.  Truck still running strong, just enjoying the cycle commuting.  
I've only drove my truck for just over 2,000 miles this year so far, and about 1,000 of those miles were from two trips to Ft. Lauderdale and back (Hi, Christine!!).

With that scorching, Florida heat came some great sunsets!!  Watching the the sky get dark while feeling the air cool down; summer sunsets are great!!

Summer is over and we are well into fall.  Temperatures are dropping and I feel like expediting things by changing latitude and altitude a bit. 
Planning to head North into Georgia and seek a bit cooler weather.  Campfire will be nice!!
Most likely wind up in the Carolinas and/or Tennessee at some point; sticking around the Southern Appalachian region.

Hope to see you soon!!
