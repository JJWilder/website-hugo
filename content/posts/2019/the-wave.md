On October 21st of 2019, Buster and myself embarked on a bodacious adventure to find the most popular Wave in Arizona.

I was passing through Kanab, UT mid-October and the weekend was nearing.  I decided I was going to hunker down in town for the weeks end; the weekend brings the crowds even in the desert, especially in this desert.  I was camping just outside of town and ended up stopping by the BLM office in the morning just as they were opening.  Wanted to get some maps and advice for some hiking and outdoor activities in the area.  

Welp, they were just about to hold the lotto for permits to go to the Wave and I figured I'd give it a go.  They only allow about 20 people everyday to enter North Coyote Buttes, the area the Wave is in.  10 of those people are chosen months in advance by entering an online lotto of sorts, and 10 are chosen the day before, also lotto style.  
My name was picked on the second day!! 

Anywho, North Coyote Buttes is a beautiful area.  The permits keep the people numbers low, so plenty of solitude and great scenery out there.  I hit the trail early and hiked to where the Wave is.  Great rock formations all throughout the area.  The Wave is the Mona Lisa of them, but so much beauty all around.  I did a fair amount of exploring and it was definitely worth going off the beaten path.  

Stateline Campground is a great little BLM camp site just a few miles from the trailhead to the Wave, which is also the trailhead to Buckskin Gulch, an amazing slot canyon.  Great area, great camping, great people!!
