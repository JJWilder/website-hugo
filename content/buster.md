Buster is bold, Buster is brave, Buster is not blue.  

I've only known Buster for a few years now, but our friendship has grown greatly over the many miles we have traveled.  From the warm Summer months of the Rockies to the hot Winter months of Florida, we have enjoyed each others company greatly.
