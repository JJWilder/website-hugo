Well, this is the beginning. A Man, a Fork, a Canvas.

Hello and Welcome!! I live to paint and paint to live. I’ve never been much of a painter until I found inspiration in my fork. One day, while eating a bowl of cereal with my 18/8 Stainless Dinner Fork, I thought to myself, if I have the patience to eat a bowl of cereal with a fork I can surely paint with it. That began the journey.

I make posts about Fork Painting; the love of my life and also the dramas of Zeckos; the bane of all human existence. You’ll find links to the categories below. I hope you enjoy!
