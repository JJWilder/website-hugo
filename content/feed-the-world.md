Well, this is the beginning. A Man, a Fork, and the world as his Canvas.

###### Hello and Welcome!!  
I live to paint and paint to live. Iâ€™ve never been much of a painter until I found inspiration in my fork. One day, while eating a bowl of cereal with my 18/8 Stainless Dinner Fork, I thought to myself, if I have the patience to eat a bowl of cereal with a fork I can surely paint with it. That began the journey.

I make posts about Fork Painting; the love of my life and also the dramas of Zeckos; the bane of all human existence. 

You'll most likely see some posts about interesting places I've been, too.

I hope you enjoy!!
